    <img alt="Image of my family" src="./images/myfamily.jpg" >
    <H2>My name is Jann</H2>
    <p>I live in Maryland, but I grew up in Arizona. 
        I am the youngest of ten children. I am married to James. 
        We have six children, four girls and two boys. 
        We have gained through marriage, two sons-in-law and one daughter-in-law. 
        We also have an adorable 3 year old granddaughter, Amelia. 
        We will celebrate our 31st wedding anniversary in May.</p>
    <p>My major is Web design and Software Development. 
        I am in my very first semester at BYUI. 
        I am looking forward to exploring my major with this class. 
        It is all completely new for me</p>
