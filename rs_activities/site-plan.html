        The purpose of Relief Society is to save souls and relieve suffering. 
        To help accomplish this purpose, the Savage Mill Ward is planning activities monthly. 
        These activities will happen at 7:00 pm, the first Thursday of every month. 
        They are an opportunity to strengthen each other, share testimony, bring sisters closer to Jesus Christ, 
        and serve others in our community. Our hope is that the sisters in our Relief Society will
        feel the love of the Savior, and the love of each other.

        Here are a few activities we have had in the past. 
        We thought you would enjoy seeing what kinds of things we have planned and carried out.
        December 2022 was so much fun. We had a lovely dinner, and sisters read a Christmas book to help us get in the Christmas spirit.
        January 2023, we renewed with three speakers that talked to us about making goals and reaching them. 
        We learned to stretch ourselves physically, spiritually and mentally to have a more balanced life.
        February 2023 was our service auction. Definitely a favorite. Sisters donated goods and services 
        and we bid on them with points we earned through doing good things like scripture study, prayer and serving others.
        April 2023, we participated in a service project that benefited one of our neighbors. We prepared their 
        landscape for planting and planted beautiful flowers.
        May 2023, we made a star craft. It was so fun to see all the creativity of the sisters.
        June 2023 was our summer block party. We played games and visited and ate yummy food.

        In July, we celebrate our ancestors on July 24th. 
        This month we will be asking sisters to find some time to do family history. 
        It can be indexing, or adding a memory or searching for family members that 
        need their work done in the temple. We invite you to share what you have done on our ward Facebook page. 
        We hope as you share what you have done, others will be inspired by your example.
        Augustâ€™s activity will be a Relief Society sponsored trip to do an endowment session 
        in the Washington DC Temple. Hopefully with the emphasis on family history in July, 
        sisters will have their own family name to do the endowment for. Join us Friday,
         August 4th for the 10 am session. Remember you will need to make an appointment. 
         We will meet at the temple. If you need babysitting, some of the young women have 
         offered to babysit for free so you can attend. Contact the activities committee if you need babysitting, and if you need a ride.
         In September we will be doing a service activity. More details will be coming.
         In October we will be focusing on how to help our families remember the true meaning of Christmas. 
         We will share ideas on how to prepare early so that the Christmas season is focused on Christ.
         In November we will be focusing on gratitude by making gratitude journals. 
         Bring a small notebook and we will provide materials to decorate it.
         December will be a celebration of the birth of the Savior. 
         Join us as we remember Jesus Christ and the blessings we receive because He was born.
