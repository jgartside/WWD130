        <p class="past">Here are a few activities we have had in the past. 
            We thought you would enjoy seeing what kinds of things we have planned and carried out.</p>
        <p class="dec">December 2022 was so much fun. We had a lovely dinner, and sisters read a Christmas 
            book to help us get in the Christmas spirit.</p>

        <p class="jan">January 2023, we renewed with three speakers who talked to us about making goals and reaching them. 
            We learned to stretch ourselves physically, spiritually and mentally to have a more balanced life.</p>

        <p class="feb">February 2023 was our service auction. Definitely a favorite. Sisters donated goods and services 
            and we bid on them with points we earned through doing good things like scripture study, prayer and serving others.</p>

        <p class="apr">April 2023, we participated in a service project that benefited one of our neighbors. We prepared their 
            landscape for planting and planted beautiful flowers.</p>
        <img src="./Images/april.jpg" alt="invitation">
        <p class="may">May 2023, we made a star craft. It was so fun to see all the creativity of the sisters.</p>
        <img src="./Images/may.jpg" alt="Stars">
        <p class="jun">June 2023 was our summer block party. We played games and visited and ate yummy food.</p>
